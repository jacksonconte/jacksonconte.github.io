### Programming Language "Hot Takes" (just for fun!)
> Java is alright until you add "script" to the end of it.

> Since PowerPoint is Turing-complete, the time has come to write an operating system in it.

> Assembly is for wimps. *Real* programmers type machine code in hex.

> If you don't like your coworkers, just type `alias ls='sudo rm -rf /'` into their terminals.
